# <h1>Monopoly-Themed Project</h1>

Welcome to the Monopoly-themed project! This application is a digital version of the classic Monopoly game, with added functionalities and enhancements inspired by the popular board game. The project is divided into two main components: the backend, located in the `CatanBackend` folder, and the frontend, housed in the `frontend` folder.

## <h2>Technologies Used</h2>

The project is built using the following technologies:

- <b>Spring Framework:</b> The backend is developed using the Spring Framework, providing a robust and scalable foundation for the application.
- <b>PostgreSQL:</b> PostgreSQL is used as the primary database for managing and storing game data.
- <b>React:</b> The frontend is implemented with React, offering a dynamic and responsive user interface for players.
- <b>Redis:</b> Using Redis, I save the state of the game

## <h2>Project Structure</h2>

- <b>CatanBackend Folder:</b> This folder contains the backend code of the application, built with the Spring Framework. It handles the game logic, communication with the database, and provides APIs for the frontend.
- <b>Frontend Folder:</b> The frontend folder includes all the React components, stylesheets, and other assets necessary for the user interface.
